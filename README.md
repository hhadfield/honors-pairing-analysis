# honors-pairing-analysis
This repository holds two functions which were used to analyze movies of the pairing dynamics of fluorescent transgenes that marked homologous loci in early embryonic _Drosophila_ embryos.

**CheckingPairingMyron** will output the percent of nuclei analyzed in the movie that have pairing homologous loci, which is defined as homologous loci with an interhomolog distance of less than 0.65um for 4 minutes.

**CheckingStickiness** will output the percent of nuclei analyzed in the movie that have homologous loci which had a chance to pair, which is defined as at least one instance of interhomolog distance of less than 0.65um.
